![What is the name of your form question page. Screenshot](screenshots/002-form-create-a-form.png)
*Page with “What is the name of your form?” question heading.*

There is hint text that says, “The form name will be shown at the top of each page of the form. Use a name that describes what the form will help people to do. For example ‘Apply for a juggling licence’.” above a text input.

Below the text input is a green “Save and continue” button.
