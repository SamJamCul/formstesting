# Service maps

This document gives details and links to service maps we have created over time during the GOV.UK Forms design process.  

What is a service map, sometimes called a service blueprint:

“A service blueprint is a diagram that visualizes the relationships between different service components — people, props (physical or digital evidence), and processes — that are directly tied to touchpoints in a specific customer journey." [Source Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/service-blueprints-definition/)

GOV.UK Forms service maps visually represent users’ journeys and their interactions with the platfrom as they create forms. The maps are created for a specific purpose and have different level of detail and infromation also based on the product's phase at the time of creation. 

## Collecting data journey map
In the early alpha phase, we created a process map that shows the journey a department takes to create a form to collect data and the various people who would be involved in each step.
The map includes all the steps from when the need for a new or updated form arises for example due to a policy change, to when the form is created, used to collect data, and then archived or retired. We made the map to capture the team's assumptions and insights, and to identify any gaps or risks in each stage of the process.

## GOV.UK Forms user journey map for Alpha Assessment 
Ahead of the Alpha assessment, we made a detailed user journey map that shows how people could use the GOV.UK Forms service to create an online form. The steps in the journey and the user’s interactions on the proposed platform were informed by insights and assumptions we made from user research carried out in alpha. The map also showed the pain points and needs that users would have at different points of the journey when creating forms on GOV.UK Forms.

## User journey map creating online forms using GOV.UK Forms in private beta
This map explained how people in government departments could use GOV.UK Forms to create accessible online forms during the early private beta phase. The map showed the steps for discovering and accessing GOV.UK Forms, including the onboarding process, agreeing to the MOU and getting access to the platform with the help of a GOV.UK Forms team member. It also showed how to create forms and make them live, and what happens when a form goes live. This map was created for new team members and anyone interested in learning about how GOV.UK Forms works.

## End-to-end journey creating forms on GOV.UK Forms in Early Access
GOV.UK Forms started the ‘Early access’ phase in November 2023 to allow anyone with a gov.uk email address to create a trial account to see how the platform works. With a trial account users could create forms and request to upgrade to an editor account that has full permissions to create and make the forms live. We created this detailed map and storyboard to show the form creators step by step journey using GOV.UK Forms in early access, for anyone who needed to understand the process.
