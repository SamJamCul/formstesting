# Service maps

This document gives details and links to service maps we have created over time during the GOV.UK Forms design process.  

What is a service map, sometimes called a service blueprint:

“A service blueprint is a diagram that visualizes the relationships between different service components — people, props (physical or digital evidence), and processes — that are directly tied to touchpoints in a specific customer journey." [Source Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/service-blueprints-definition/)

In GOV.UK Forms, we create service maps to visually represent users’ journeys and their interactions with the platfrom as they create forms. The maps are designed for a specific purpose and therefore contain varying levels of detail and information also depending on the product's phase at the time of creation.
