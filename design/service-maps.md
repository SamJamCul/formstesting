# Design documentation

We use this part of the GOV.UK Forms repo to record design work and decisions we’ve made.  

You can explore our initial versions of GOV.UK Forms, the prototypes we tested, and new features as they’ve been iterated and adapted based on user research, data and new design patterns.  

## Prototype version history

At the start of alpha we explored the wider product, focusing on quick iterations across whole journeys. This helped us get a clearer picture of our minimum viable product (MVP) so we could baseline where we wanted to start work from.  

* [Prototype version 1](prototype-version-1)
* [Prototype version 2](prototype-version-2)
* [Prototype version 3](prototype-version-3)
* [Prototype version 4](prototype-version-4)
* [Prototype version 5](prototype-version-5)
* [Prototype version 6](prototype-version-6)

## Features

Once we had a baseline that worked for form creators we shifted focus onto key features. The aim was to help align GOV.UK Forms with the key functionality that would help form creators make more of their forms with our product. We used the team’s analysis of feature coverage of forms across GOV.UK to help us priorititse this work. 

You can explore the [features](features) as we’ve designed them and see how they’ve been iterated based on user research and feedback through private beta and ‘early access’. ('Early access' is the period in which we’re encouraging people to try out GOV.UK Forms to see if it’s suitable for them).
