# Design documentation

We use this part of the GOV.UK Forms repo to record design work and decisions we have made.  

You can explore our initial versions of the GOV.UK Forms, the prototypes we tested and new features as they have been iterated and adapted based on user research, data and new design patterns.  

## Prototype version history

At the start of alpha we explored the wider product, focusing on quick iterations across whole journeys. This helped us get a clearer picture of our minimum viable product (MVP) we could baseline where we wanted to start work from.  

* [Prototype version 1](prototype-version-1)
* [Prototype version 2](prototype-version-2)
* [Prototype version 3](prototype-version-3)
* [Prototype version 4](prototype-version-4)
* [Prototype version 5](prototype-version-5)
* [Prototype version 6](prototype-version-6)

## Features

Once we had a baseline that worked for form creators we shifted focus on to key features to help align GOV.UK Forms with the key functionality to help form creators make more of their forms with our product. This involved using the teams analysis of feature coverage of forms across GOV.UK to help us priorititse work. 

You can explore the [features](features) as we have designed them and how they have been iterated based on user research and feedback through private beta and early access.
