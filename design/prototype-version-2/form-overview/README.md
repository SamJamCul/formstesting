# Form overview page

## Context

For this round of testing we updated the content of the hint text to help give form creators more guidance about where the name of their form will be used.  

As part of the testing we asked users to create a form, and then explored returning to edit an existing form, including the task of changing the name of a form, based on feedback from a colleague.  

## What we tested last time

![Old version of what is the name of your form question page. Screenshot](../../prototype-version-1/screenshots/002-Create-a-form.png)  
*Page with “What is the name of your form?” question heading.*

There is hint text that says, “Use a name that describes what the form will help people to do. For example, ‘Apply for a licence’.” above a text input.

Below the text input is a green “Save and continue” button.

### What we saw

## What we changed and why

We updated the hint text content to help give form creators more context of what the name they give will be used for and where they can expect to see it. We believe that this will give them confidence and a nudge to give the form a useful name that reflects the [service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service).

*Page with “What is the name of your form?” question heading.*

There is hint text that says, “The form name will be shown at the top of each page of the form. Use a name that describes what the form will help people to do. For example, ‘Apply for a licence’.” above a text input.

Below the text input is a green “Save and continue” button.
