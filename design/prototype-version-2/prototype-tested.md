# Prototype version 2

Dates tested: 2022-05-12 to 2022-05-13

## Status

Superceeded by [version 3](../prototype-version-3)

## Context

> Give a brief overview of
> - what we wanted to test for example, the main journey or user needs
> - what tasks we gave to users

For this round of testing we want to get a baseline with our first private beta partners.

We plan to test the full creation of a sample form as if the user has already logged into the GOV.UK Forms platform and is re-creating one of their departments existing forms.


## Screenshots

> List the screenshots of the different pages across the journeys.  
> These should have alt text where appropriate, and a link to the detailed changes we want to call out on those screenshots.  
> For example  
> ### GOV.UK Forms landing page  
> ![alt text](screenshots/001-forms-landing.png)  
> *Description of what can be seen in the screenshot, to make it easier for screen reader users and if the images do not load.  
>  
> Consider adding links to prototype screens for latest version of pages

## What we learned

> Give a synopsis of the key findings from the round of research we tested this version.  
> Include examples of found needs, pain points or quotes to help explain the findings. These do not have to be too detailed, as this should be covered in the research findings packs/decks - which can be linked to from here.


## Opportunities (optional)

> Are there any opportunities we would like to explore, or ideas that we think we could consider?  
> List these here. They do not have to be full formulated at this point, but will inform our work (and should be added to Trello to discuss and ideate as a team).
