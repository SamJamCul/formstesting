## What

This feature is introduces functionality within the form building tool to help form creators quickly return to edit questions while previewing the full form as though they are a person completing the form. It introduces a clearer route for form creators to navigate between preview and edit.  

<br>

## Why

When users were testing their forms the wanted to step through the pages as an end user (form filler) would. As they travelled through their form, they spotted some mistakes within some pages and wanted to quickly get back to the editor screen for that page.  

It is currently causing issues as some lower digitally confident users aren't realising they are in a new window/tab and are trying to click back to return to the editor.  

Once they get back to the form overview page they have forgotten what page it was they saw the error.  

## Hypothesis

**We believe** by offering them an "Edit this page" option somewhere within the test/preview journey they will be able to fix mistakes quicker and easier.
