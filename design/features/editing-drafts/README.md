## What

This feature introduces functionality in the form building tool to help form creators return to edit their questions more quickly when previewing the form as if they’re someone who’s filling it in. It introduces a clearer, simpler route for form creators to navigate between previewing and editing their form.

## Why

When users were testing their forms in preview they wanted to step through the pages and view them as an end user (form filler) would. As they travelled through their form, they spotted mistakes within certain pages and wanted to quickly get back to the edit screen for that particular page in order to change it.  

This is currently causing issues as some users with lower digital confidence are not realising that they're in a new window/tab. They're therefore trying to click the back button to return to the edit screen but finding that this is not possible.  

Once they do manage to get back to the form overview page they've often forgotten which page they saw the error on.  

## Hypothesis

We believe that by offering form creators an "Edit this page" option somewhere within the test/preview journey they'll be able to fix mistakes more quickly and easily.
