## What

### As-is

- currently we take users to a new tab to preview their form as a form filler would see it  
- there is a “DRAFT” watermark on the background of these screens, which we hope will help form creators keep the “creation” mindset (hat)  
- there is no easy way for users to get back to the edit pages  
- in rounds of research the new tab caused issues and users tried to click the back button to edit pages, with some being lost and needing prompting from the researcher  
- some users suggested being able to quickly edit pages they were on when they saw an issue or error, like a typo or incorrect input type  

### To-be

- form creator creates their questions and can preview their form in “DRAFT” as a form filler would see it  
- preview is now in the same window/tab as the main form creation journey  
- there is a clear way for the form creator to edit the current question page they are viewing  
- there is an easy way to get back to previewing their form where they left off
