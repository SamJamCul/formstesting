## What
This journey is designed to allow peopel to create a trial account and request an upgrade to an editor account - so they can make live forms to be published on GOV.UK. 

<br>

## Problems we tried to solve
* The current process to create an account and agree to an MOU is all manual and requires the adoption team
* There is no way for someone to create their own trial account or request to be upgraded to make forms live
* There is also no process in place for the adoption team to receive requests to be upgraded to editor

<br>

## User needs 
 * As someone who is interested in using GOV.UK Forms, I need to be able to make a trial account to try it out
 * As a trial account user, I need to know if and how I can upgrade my account so I can make forms live
 * As a member of the adoption team, I need to know if someone requests to be upgraded to editor, and if the basic information about their form requirements
 * As a member of the adoption team, I need to know if someone has agreed to the MOU in a specific organisation 
 * As a member of the adoption team, I need to make sure that organisations have agreed to an MOU before their users get permissions beyond a trial account.

<br>


## Changes
We have created a new journey which starts from the GOV.UK Forms product site. It allows people to create a trial account, try out the product then request to be upgraded if it meets their needs. This then alerts the adoption team who can process the request - including ensuring that the relevant department has agreed to the MOU. 

The changes are in the product. 

The prototype can be found here: https://forms-prototypes-pr-201.herokuapp.com/product-pages/ 

<br>

## What we did 
* We ran a series of team activities to ideate and refine what the new journey would look like for trial users - [the workshop murals can be found here](https://app.mural.co/t/gaap0347/m/gaap0347/1691659258399/af093136c3f86be05860120cb92d6810e98f3643?sender=u61ceb93b0f861033ca7c7448 "Workshops can be found here") 
* We sketched and made multiple iterations of the design and user journey and then we began implementing the designs into the GOV.UK Forms product
* [We tested the journey with the users](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sd4y8xXPDyxw_yThsA5qNmatAqjb-rpYvctYMflgCJQ/edit)

## Outcome

* We made content improvements for the journey based on the [user research findings](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sd4y8xXPDyxw_yThsA5qNmatAqjb-rpYvctYMflgCJQ/edit#slide=id.g1e7dce5d897_0_37)
