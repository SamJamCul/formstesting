## What
This journey is for trial users requesting to become editor so that they can start publishing their forms on GOV.UK. 

<br>

## Problems we tried to solve
* There is currently no process in place where users can request to become an editor, sign mou and go through requirements check to become an editor.
* There is also no process in place for adoption to receive requests for editor acccess

<br>

## User needs: 
 * As a trial user I need to know what are the criteria and steps to become an editor
 * As a trial user I need to know whether someone has agreed to the MOU in my organisation 
 * As a GOV.UK Forms team, I need to make sure that organisations have signed an MOU before their users get permissions beyond trial.

<br>


## Changes
We have created a new journey which starts from product page and connects the users to the adoption team. 

The changes are in the product. 
Prototype can be found here: https://forms-prototypes-pr-201.herokuapp.com/product-pages/ 

<br>

## What we did 
* We ran a series of team activities to ideate and refine what the new journey would look like for trial users.[Workshops can be found here](https://app.mural.co/t/gaap0347/m/gaap0347/1691659258399/af093136c3f86be05860120cb92d6810e98f3643?sender=u61ceb93b0f861033ca7c7448 "Workshops can be found here") 
* We sketched and made multiple iterations of the design and user journey and then we began implementing the designs into the GOV.UK Forms product.
* [We tested the journey with the users.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sd4y8xXPDyxw_yThsA5qNmatAqjb-rpYvctYMflgCJQ/edit)

<br>

## Outcome 
* [The first itearation we tested during UR.](https://www.figma.com/file/pCN39S9tIDlgicZ05Nj47J/Early-Access?type=design&node-id=337%3A3586&mode=design&t=0R6O7wWl9Alok9vs-1 "The first iteration we tested during UR.")
* We created content improvements for the early access journey based on the [user feedback.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sd4y8xXPDyxw_yThsA5qNmatAqjb-rpYvctYMflgCJQ/edit#slide=id.g1e7dce5d897_0_37)
