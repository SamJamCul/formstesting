## What

This is a journey outlining how users access to 

### User stories

**As a trial user**, I need to know what are the criteria to become an editor
**As a trial user**, As a trial user I need to let the Forms team know my organisation. 
**As a trial user**, I need to know whether someone has agreed to the MOU in my organisation 


<br>

## Why

Currently we do not have any way where trial users can request to become an editor and publish their form. With this journey, users can create a trial account and understand if they can upgrade to editor and how to do that. It will also automate a lot of things the adoption team would have to do otherwise, and take us a step closer to self service.


We believe that by creating an earlya access journey we will be able to help users request editor and sign the MOU process.
