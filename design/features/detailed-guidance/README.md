## What

This feature introduces new functionality to the form building tool to allow form creators to add more complex help text to a question page above the question.  

Note that this is the best way to introduce complex information where most, if not all, form completers have the need to see it in order to complete a single question.  
Where a minority of users need additional guidance, such as a details (show hide) component, a separate feature will need to be explored and considered.  
Further, where a need is established for a complex piece of guidance or instructions to be added before a section or group of questions this will need to be considered as part of yet another future feature, such as an interstitual page.

### User stories

**As a form creator**, I need to add content before a question, so that the user has any context that they need to answer that question.

**As a form filler**, I need to understand how to answer a question, so that I feel confident about my answer and donâ€™t need to go looking for help.

## Why

When form creators create questions they are currently using quite long questions with hint text to explain the information that is required of the form completers. We have seen form creators try to insert links to relevant guidance pages or reference documents as part of the hint text in order to help their users compelte their form effectively.  
This is not an accessible implementation with the components from the design system and how the page displays and reacts with assistive technology due to the way question text, hint text and inputs are associated.  

There is a pattern with on the design system that looks at more complex questions that require additional information to explain to form compelters how to compelte a specific question at the time of need, while answering the question in the form.  

## Hypothesis

We believe that by offering the ability to add more complex information, in a formatted way, before a question form fillers can direct form completers to the correct data and level of detail of information that is required to answer a difficult question.  

We believe this offering will improve data collected improving processing times and overall help the form completers get to the outcome they need.
