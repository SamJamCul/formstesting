## What

This feature introduces new functionality to the form building tool to allow form creators to see how their form is performing. We’ll be starting with a minimum offering of: number of forms started, number of forms submitted, and completion rate.

This information should cover at least a week of data collected. We’ll look to improve this offering over time and will investigate introducing filters to help form creators adapt data for their needs.  

### User stories

**As a form creator**, I need to see how well my form is doing, so that I can make improvements to it and/or create reports.

<br>

## Why

Currently form creators, or a designated contact within the department or team, receive a spreadsheet created manually by our performance analyst. This spreadsheet shows basic metrics such as weekly submissions, completion rate and page dropouts. This information has helped form creators make improvements to their forms shortly after launching, meaning they’re able to reduce dropouts on problem pages and get better data overall.  

## Hypothesis

We believe that by offering form creators a self-serve view of basic metrics they’ll be able to improve their forms without needing our performance analyst to provide manual reports.  

We believe that by doing this before we get into early access (and private beta later on) we’ll hopefully reduce the impact on the team of new GOV.UK Forms adoptions.
