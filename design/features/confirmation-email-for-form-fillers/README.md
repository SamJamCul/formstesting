## What

This feature introduces new functionality to the form fillers journey allowing them to request an email confirming that they have successfully submitted a form. 

### User stories

**As a form creator**, I need to know how the content I write will be used, so that I know what information to include to help our form fillers.

**As a form filler**, I need confirmation my form has been submitted, so that I feel confident that I have completed my task.

**As a form filler**, I need a record of my submission, so that I have a reminder of when I sent my form, and know that I can chase if I havenâ€™t heard back.

<br>

## Why

Currently, when a form is submitted the form filler is shown a confirmation screen telling them that their form has been submitted. This screen can also include information about what will happen next, in terms of timelines and expectation management. We know that some of our forms also use this to set out next steps that a form filler needs to complete, but these steps might not be time sensitive or require more information than a form filler has at that moment so having a record of these steps helps form fillers return to complete these tasks at a later time.  

## Hypothesis

We believe that by offering form fillers a way to request an email confirming that they submitted the form with the form name, date and time of submission, and the information provided by the form creators - what happens next information and contact details for support - we will provide reassurance to form fillers while reducing the number of contacts to call centres or processing staff, allowing them to complete the task for the form filler.
