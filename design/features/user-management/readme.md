## What
We are propsing a new user management model made out of 3 main user types. These are organisation admins, super admins and standard users (group admins & editors. We are also keeping the trial accounts. 

With this new journey we are proposing these:
-‘Groups’ will give departments more granular control over who has access to groups of forms - and what permissions they have.
-This will also help move us towards a model that requires less manual intervention from the adoption team.
-This work is important in terms of scaling up our product.

<br>

## Problems we tried to solve
* With the current process, anyone can create a form and make it live. Other departments have told us that they need a control over who has access to forms and what it is being published. 
* In order to scale up our service, the Forms team also need to create a self service model to help free up some of the adoption team's capacity. 

<br>

## User needs 
 * As an organisation admin I need to know and control who has access to which forms in my organisation.
 * As a group admin I need to create and edit a form and be able to publish it on GOV.UK
 * As a group admin I need to know which forms are being created and by who
 * As an editor I need to edit forms
 * As a super admin I need to be able to see all the forms created different departments. 
<br>


## Changes
 

The changes are in the product. 

The prototype can be found here: [https://forms-prototypes-pr-201.herokuapp.com/product-pages/ ](https://forms-prototypes.herokuapp.com/product-pages/)

<br>

## What we did 
* We ran a series of team activities to ideate and refine what the new journey would look like for editor, group, organisation and super admin - [Workshop mural can be found here]([https://app.mural.co/t/gaap0347/m/gaap0347/1691659258399/af093136c3f86be05860120cb92d6810e98f3643?sender=u61ceb93b0f861033ca7c7448](https://app.mural.co/t/gaap0347/m/gaap0347/1691659258399/af093136c3f86be05860120cb92d6810e98f3643) "Mural working board")
* We sketched and made multiple iterations of the design and user journey and then we began implementing the designs into the GOV.UK Forms product
* [We tested the journey with the users]([https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sd4y8xXPDyxw_yThsA5qNmatAqjb-rpYvctYMflgCJQ/edit)

<br>

## Outcome 
* User research told us that the model came across clearly to participants from using and exploring the tool.
* Most of the assumptions they developed were correct, and the only areas of ambiguity were on very specific details.
* Central UCD teams want to have control of form creation from the start to ensure only forms that are fit for purpose and high quality are created and made live.
* People saw groups as primarily a way of organising forms in similar topic areas or categories. Permissions at group level were seen as secondary.
* Participants wanted control of the publication of forms at the form level, and the ability to run a 2i style process around publishing a form.
* Participants were confident that the features could support them to work in the way they wanted to, but this would require some thinking through in some cases to map their needs to the feature.
