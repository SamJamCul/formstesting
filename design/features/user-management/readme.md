## What

A new user management model is made out of 3 main user types and a new group model. These are organisation admins, super admins and standard users (group admins & editors). We are also keeping the trial accounts. ‘Groups’ will give departments more granular control over who has access to groups of forms - and what permissions they have. This will also help move the Forms team towards a model that requires less manual intervention from the adoption team.

* An editor can edit forms in a group but cannot make forms live. 
* A group admin can edit forms, make forms live and add editors to a group.
* Only an organisation admin can add a group admin to a group.
* Super admins are the members Forms team. 



<br>

## Problems we tried to solve
* Other departments within the government wants to have a control over who has access to forms and what it is being published.
* Departments within the government also to oversee forms being created within their department.  
* In order to scale up our service, the Forms team also need to create a self service model to help free up some of the adoption team's capacity. 
  

<br>

## User needs 
 * As an organisation admin I need to know and control who has access to which forms in my organisation.
 * As a group admin I need to create and edit a form and be able to publish it on GOV.UK
 * As a group admin I need to know which forms are being created and by who
 * As an editor I need to edit forms
 * As a super admin I need to be able to see all the forms created different departments.
 * As a form owner, I need to control who on the team can create, edit, and make a form live so that the risk of incorrect forms being published is reduced.
* As a content or publisher in my organisation, I need to know and control who has access and can create forms on GOV.UK Forms in my organisation, so that I can review and ensure UCD practices in form creation are being followed

## Changes
Breakdown of changes are in the group,editor and organisation admin folders as well as the product. 

The prototype can be found here: [https://forms-prototypes-pr-201.herokuapp.com/product-pages/ ](https://forms-prototypes.herokuapp.com/product-pages/)

<br>

## What we did 
* We ran a series of team activities to ideate and refine what the new journey would look like for editor, group, organisation and super admin - [Mural working board](https://app.mural.co/t/gaap0347/m/gaap0347/1691659258399/af093136c3f86be05860120cb92d6810e98f3643?sender=u61ceb93b0f861033ca7c7448 "Mural working board")
* We sketched and made multiple iterations of the design and user journey and then we began implementing the designs into the GOV.UK Forms product.

* We tested the journey with the users. [Research document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_zEEa2xm1VU2ekWNPktspRpvi9rOEgYQSkzbOJ8hibs/edit#slide=id.g2cb8f0e5c8b_0_33 "Research document")


<br>

## Outcome 
* User research told us that the model came across clearly to participants from using and exploring the tool.
* Most of the assumptions they developed were correct, and the only areas of ambiguity were on very specific details.
* Central UCD teams want to have control of form creation from the start to ensure only forms that are fit for purpose and high quality are created and made live.
* People saw groups as primarily a way of organising forms in similar topic areas or categories. Permissions at group level were seen as secondary.
* Participants wanted control of the publication of forms at the form level, and the ability to run a 2i style process around publishing a form.
* Participants were confident that the features could support them to work in the way they wanted to, but this would require some thinking through in some cases to map their needs to the feature.
