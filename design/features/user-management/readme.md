## What
-‘Groups’ will give departments more granular control over who has access to groups of forms - and what permissions they have.

- This will also help move us towards a model that requires less manual intervention from the adoption team.

-This work is important in terms of scaling up our product.

## What we did 
* We ran a series of team activities to ideate and refine what the new journey would look like for editor, group, organisation and super admin - [Workshop mural can be found here]([https://app.mural.co/t/gaap0347/m/gaap0347/1691659258399/af093136c3f86be05860120cb92d6810e98f3643?sender=u61ceb93b0f861033ca7c7448](https://app.mural.co/t/gaap0347/m/gaap0347/1691659258399/af093136c3f86be05860120cb92d6810e98f3643) "Mural working board")
* We sketched and made multiple iterations of the design and user journey and then we began implementing the designs into the GOV.UK Forms product
* [We tested the journey with the users]([https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sd4y8xXPDyxw_yThsA5qNmatAqjb-rpYvctYMflgCJQ/edit)
