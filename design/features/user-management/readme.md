## What
We are propsing a new user management model made out of 3 main user types. These are organisation admins, super admins and standard users (group admins & editors. We are also keeping the trial accounts. 

With this new journey we are proposing these:
-‘Groups’ will give departments more granular control over who has access to groups of forms - and what permissions they have.
-This will also help move us towards a model that requires less manual intervention from the adoption team.
-This work is important in terms of scaling up our product.

<br>

## Problems we tried to solve
* With the current process, anyone can create a form and make it live. Other departments have told us that they need a control over who has access to forms and what it is being published. 
* In order to scale up our service, the Forms team also need to create a self service model to help free up some of the adoption team's capacity. 

<br>

## User needs 
 * As an organisation admin I need to know and control who has access to which forms in my organisation.
 * As a group admin I need to create and edit a form and be able to publish it on GOV.UK
 * As a group admin I need to know which forms are being created and by who
 * As an editor I need to edit forms
 * As a super admin I need to be able to see all the forms created different departments. 
<br>


## Changes
 

The changes are in the product. 

The prototype can be found here: [https://forms-prototypes-pr-201.herokuapp.com/product-pages/ ](https://forms-prototypes.herokuapp.com/product-pages/)

<br>

## What we did 
* We ran a series of team activities to ideate and refine what the new journey would look like for editor, group, organisation and super admin - [Workshop mural can be found here]([https://app.mural.co/t/gaap0347/m/gaap0347/1691659258399/af093136c3f86be05860120cb92d6810e98f3643?sender=u61ceb93b0f861033ca7c7448](https://app.mural.co/t/gaap0347/m/gaap0347/1691659258399/af093136c3f86be05860120cb92d6810e98f3643) "Mural working board")
* We sketched and made multiple iterations of the design and user journey and then we began implementing the designs into the GOV.UK Forms product
* [We tested the journey with the users]([https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sd4y8xXPDyxw_yThsA5qNmatAqjb-rpYvctYMflgCJQ/edit)
