# Features

We use this area to record design work and decisions made, and any iterations made to improve usability for form creators and form fillers.  

## Explore the features we have designed.  

### [Confirm that a form's been submitted (form fillers)](confirmation-email-for-form-fillers)  
This feature introduces new functionality to the form filler's journey, allowing them to request an email confirming that they've successfully submitted a form.

### [Add guidance to help people answer the question ('detailed guidance')](detailed-guidance)  
This feature introduces new functionality to the form building tool to allow form creators to add more complex help text to a question page. This 'guidance' text will appear above the question, on the same page.

### [Early access journey](early-access)  
This journey is designed to allow people to create a trial account and request an upgrade to an editor account - so they can make live forms to be published on GOV.UK.

### [Editing pages when looking at a preview of a form](editing-drafts)  
This feature introduces functionality in the form building tool to help form creators return to edit their questions more quickly when previewing the form as though they're someone who's filling it in. It introduces a clearer, simpler route for form creators to navigate between previewing and editing their form.

### [Metrics for form creators](form-metrics)  
This feature introduces new functionality to the form building tool to allow form creators to see how their form is performing. Initially we’ll be starting with a minimum offering of: number of started forms, number of submitted forms, and completion rate.

### [Live and draft](live-draft)  
The ability to make a draft of a live form to prepare changes to it. You can then make all the changes live at the same time, and at an appropriate time.

### [Previewing a question](previewing-a-question)  
This feature introduces a clear and quick way to help form creators understand what an answer type will look like and how it’ll be formatted alongside other content they have added, including hint text and additional guidance.

### [Simple routing logic (skip questions)](routing)  
This feature introduces new functionality to the form building tool to help form creators create simple skip logic for questions. This means that people completing a form only need to be asked relevant questions based on a previously given answer.
