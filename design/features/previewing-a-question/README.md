## What

This feature introduces a clear and quick way to help form creators understand what an answer type will look like and how it’ll be formatted alongside other content they have added, including hint text and additional guidance.  

It is designed to be an optional journey for form creators who are unsure about what an answer type may look like, while giving them a quick idea of the overall layout as presented to form fillers.  

### User stories

**As a form creator**, I need to see what a question will look like for the form filler as part of the process of creating it, so I can be sure that I have selected the correct answer type.

## Why

Previous [usability testing (Sprint 20)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MCIzkvRmxBDsfR1BTMhKHQFQXEv7vQaDfCDUBjnAQ0g/edit#slide=id.g189252d98dc_0_129) suggested that some people would benefit from being able to see what a question will look like for the form filler as part of the process of creating it.  

* Although people can preview their form, this takes them through each screen one by one rather than viewing a particular question while they’re creating it - and the links to preview are not very prominent or part of the question creation journey - so are often missed  
* Aside from going through the full preview journey, there may be other ways we can help people understand how the question will be formatted and what the form filler will see  
* Not being able to see how a question will display may create doubt and lower some people’s confidence in their choice of question format. This may slow them down, potentially leading them to choose a less appropriate question type, or mean they struggle to write appropriate questions and hints  

## Hypothesis

We believe that offering a simple “save and preview” journey as part of the question creation journey will give confidence to form creators, and improve the usability of forms created on GOV.UK Forms as a result.
