## What

### As-is

- Form creators need to add their questions, go back to the list of questions they have added to their form and then click into the preview journey previewing every question within the form to see a single question and how it looks, and potentially will work. 

### To-be

- Form creators can add their question and get a quick preview with their content as it would appear to the form fillers. They can then continue adding questions to their form without the need to navigate back and forth.  


## Key decisions

We want to: 

- make the smallest quick win change we think will benefit form creators  
- make sure the preview works for any assistive technology, something we had found issues with previously
- make the preview a conscious choice for form creators so as they learn the product they can skip over unnecessary screens
