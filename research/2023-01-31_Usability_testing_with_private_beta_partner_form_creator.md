## Users
- Civil Servants
- 1

## Methodology
- Usability Testing

## Key Headlines 

- Form creator was able to create all questions without any major issues
- Used statements from the original form (Name:) rather than conversational questions (What is your name?)
- Expected questions to have validation, tested this with preview and was satisfied with this feature. 
- Some uncertainty about when to use single and multiple lines of text. This appeared to stem from not knowing what the questions would look like to the end user when creating them.
- Expected the save question button to take them to a different page rather than save only.
- Copied and pasted long hints that did not fit the hint text boxes. Commented that the boxes could be larger.
