# Accessibility Testing- Detailed Guidance and Simple Routing

## Key Headlines 

- The ‘add a question route’ journey was accessible and straightforward for users.
- Most users successfully added detailed guidance, using a combination of the buttons, typing input based on ‘formatting help’, and checking using the preview.
- The ‘detailed guidance’ formatting buttons did not work well for screen reader users. But the guidance and typed markdown did.
- Previewing formatted guidance poses some challenges for screen reader users.
- There were a range of quite specific issues identified for us to look into further. These were mostly issues for screen reader users.
- Most of our users successfully created a form with guidance and routing. This included people using significant assistive technology, including one person using an iPhone entirely interacting with VoiceOver.
