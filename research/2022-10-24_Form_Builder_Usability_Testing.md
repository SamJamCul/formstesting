## Key Headlines

- Overall, a very positive experience for all users with many completing the tasks quickly and easily.
- Adding a name question: some users were uncertain how to create a name question with multiple parts to it such as first name, last name, prefix.
- Preview pane: users found and used preview pane more easily than in some preview sessions.Users were looking for an option to preview the entire form on the task list page.
- Add content to a page: one user copied and pasted a very long question, which displayed poorly. This led them to simplify the question they were asking.
- The form overview page: some users found numbering on the task list page felt inconsistent.
- Users looked for ways to complete the 'in progress' tag next to the 'add and edit questions' link
- There were problems with navigating between the 'form overview' page and the 'create a form' page. This often resulted in users becoming stuck and unsure how to progress.  
- There was some confusion from less digitally confident users about what 'preview in a new tab' meant or did.
- Add a declaration: there was some confusion from less digitally confident users about whether the declaration page was for them or form completers.
