# Processing (including processing timings)

## Key Headlines

- When there is missing information, GOV.UK Forms can make a big difference to processing time for the forms tested.
- Even compared to straightforward, complete forms, GOV.UK Forms still saves time.
- Existing forms completed correctly: 24 seconds saved per form (on average) - 36% faster.
- Forms with errors or missing information: 67 seconds saved per form (on average) - 55% faster.
- Potential time saved per year for this form: 51 hours (2,750 forms p.a. with a 67 second saving per form).
- Processors said that GOV.UK Forms output would be easier to read and process if there was clearer delineation between questions and responses.
- The addition of detail from the completed form in the subject line would make the process more efficient for processors.  It would allow them to store forms and organise them with unique names/subjects.
- Having form completers answer to the email question formatted as a mailto: link makes it convenient to contact them.
- There was a comment that the personal information in emails was very visible in inboxes, especially if using preview panes.
