# Understanding mental models of document-based form creators with a specific focus on the multiple responses to a question question type

2022-10-17 / Sprint 11, 12 and 13

## Aims
- To understand the mental models for document-based form creators when creating forms and authoring questions
- To gather examples of language used by document-based form creators to describe the process of building a form, and different types of questions
- To understand how document-based form creators approach questions collecting information about multiple things or people

## Users
- Civil Servants
- 10 users

## Methodology
- User interviews, interactive activities / observation of activities

## Key Headlines

- Form creators expect our online forms to be different to their document based forms, although they didn’t have strong expectations of what the form builder would be like.
- Document based forms are often limited by presentation designed for processors. Some also have ‘for official use only’ fields.
- There is some feeling that these considerations sometimes hold back forms from being easy to use for form completers.
- We may want to look at presenting information differently for processors than form completers
- People generally think about complex question types in context and not abstractly as ‘repeating questions’ or other types.
- There is some specific language used that we might want to bear in mind in our content.Template questions were not widely used, although people often refer to existing forms.
- Some people feel their departments try not to create new forms, but very regularly update existing ones.
- Some forms have very detailed notes for form completers.
- When asked to create a question considering multuple pieces of information about multiple objects, there were broadly three approaches demonstrated: A table, repeating sections per object, repeating sections per piece of information.
- Some participants changed the order of the information to put the easiest items to answer first.
- One participant suggested hints in our product explaining that question type is ‘equivalent to a Word table’.
- Some of the participants have specialised roles such as graphic design, and might not be the people creating forms with our tool."
