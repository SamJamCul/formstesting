# Mental Models Of Document Based Form Creators

## Key Headlines
- Form creators expect our online forms to be different to their document based forms, although they didn’t have strong expectations of what the form builder would be like.
- Document based forms are often limited by presentation designed for processors. Some also have ‘for official use only’ fields. There is some feeling that these considerations sometimes hold back forms from being easy to use for form completers. We may want to look at presenting information differently for processors than form completers
- People generally think about complex question types in context and not abstractly. The consider the context of the information they are gathering and design questions based on this, rather than selecting abstract question types such as ‘repeating questions’.
- There is some specific language used that we might want to bear in mind in our content. This is detailed in the report.
- Template questions were not widely used, although people often refer to existing forms.
- Some people feel their departments try not to create new forms, but very regularly update existing ones.
- Some forms have very detailed notes for form completers.
- When asked to create a question considering multiple pieces of information about multiple objects, there were broadly three approaches demonstrated: A table, repeating sections per object, repeating sections per piece of information.
- Some participants changed the order of the information to put the easiest items to answer first.
- One participant suggested hints in our product explaining that question type is ‘equivalent to a Word table’.
- Some of the participants have specialised roles such as graphic design, and would likely not be the target audience for our product.
