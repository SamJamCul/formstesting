# EPIC A TESTING SECURITY FEATURES
## KEY HEADLINES 
DPOs and cyber/security are supportive of GOV.UK Forms. They believe in the value of digitalising forms. They are seen as a quicker, safer and better solution. 

Our proposition is fully endorsed by all and meets key needs around reducing risk and providing more control over data. All our security features are from tried and trusted methods of security. 

Front-end features are a key selling point as they can help overcome problems around data minimalization, accuracy and storage. Desirable features include limits over free text boxes, mandatory privacy notices, built-in tips/ advice on good practice.

We can further meet their needs for control by providing a dashboard where all forms are stored. It would include a tagging system highlighting high risk forms and information on who created forms and when.

Our primary user group will not be aware of the practices involved in managing digital data. We can help with their transition by providing DPIA templates to help with good practice.
