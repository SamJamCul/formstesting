# Form Processing

## Key Headlines

- The service operates over two stages: A closed time frame (response within 14 days), and an open timeframe (claims can be made over years).
- There are 3 reasons why form completers have to complete their form over two stages:
-- The completer is often is a state of stress and urgently needs to process their claim to get paid. This may mean they don’t have all the information at this fingertips at the time of submission.
-- There are some parts of the claim that extremely time-consuming e.g. submitting 52 weeks of payslips. Claimants may not have these available or be able to upload these in one session.
-- Sometimes new information comes to light which means the form becomes out of date and the claimant may be owed more than initially thought. This happens in approx. 10% of cases.
- Data is received in different formats and manually transposed into the CMS.
- 75% of form completers are typing in and 25% are hand writing.
- It takes time and effort to manually transpose data. 161 forms per week, 3 minutes per form, leads to 8 hours per week or 14 days per year.
- Sometimes caseworkers cannot use copy and paste to transpose data and they have to type data in by hand (e.g. when data is entered in the wrong format).
- Often there are problems with the forms when they arrive which can make them more time consuming to process. For example:
-- can’t read writing
-- photo image is blurred
-- users haven’t entered information correctly
-- information added in the wrong format
-- sent from incorrect email address
- When these errors occur, a caseworker contacts the form completer to try and resolve the problem. In more complex scenarios, the case may be escalated to another member of staff to resolve it.
- We ran some research to measure what errors occurred and how long they took to resolve over a one week period. Problems experienced included:
-- Discrepancies in data
-- Incorrect email/ unable to verify form completer
-- Missing information/ incomplete form
-- Completer gives information that is not eligible for the service
- The time taken to resolve different errors can vary markedly depending on the error type. Missing information can take just a few minutes, a big change can take half an hour.
- Total time spent on resolving errors over the course of the week was 1 hour 23 mins.
