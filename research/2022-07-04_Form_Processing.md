## Key Headlines

- The service operates over two stages: A closed time frame (statutory payment made within 14 days), and an open timeframe (claims can be made over years).
- There are 3 reasons why claimants have to complete their form over two stages:
- (1)  The claimant is often is a state of stress and urgently needs to process their claim to get paid. This may mean they don’t have all the information at this fingertips at the time of submission.
- (2) There are some parts of the claim that extremely time-consuming e.g. submitting 52 weeks of payslips. Claimants may not have these available or be able to upload these in one session.
- (3) Sometimes new information comes to light which means the form becomes out of date and the claimant may be owed more than initially thought. This happens in approx. 10% of cases.
- Data is received in different formats and manually transposed into the CMS.
- 75% of form completers are typing in and 25% are hand writing in.
- It takes time and effort to manually transpose data. 161 forms per week, 3 minutes per form, leads to 8 hours per week or 14 days per year.
- Sometimes caseworkers cannot use copy and paste to transpose data and they have to type data in by hand (e.g. when data is entered in the wrong format).
- Often there are problems with the forms when they arrive which can make them more time consuming to process. For example: can’t read writing, photo image is blurred, users haven’t entered information correctly, information added in the wrong format, sent from incorrect email address. When these errors occur, a caseworker contacts the claimant to try and resolve the problem. In more complex scenarios, the case may be referred to an Insolvency Practitioner (IP) to resolve it.
- We ran some research to measure what errors occurred and how long they took to resolve over a one week period. Problems experienced included:discrepancy in data, incorrect email/ unable to verify claimant, providing lump sums vs. installments, missing information/ incomplete form, claimant tries to carry over holiday from previous year, claimant not being paid. The time taken to resolve different errors can vary markedly depending on the error type. Missing information can take just a few minutes, a big change can take half an hour.The total time spent on resolving errors = 1 hour 23 mins.
