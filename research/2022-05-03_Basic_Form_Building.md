# Basic form building

## Key Headlines

- The landing page: users were initially confused when arriving on the landing page and had a need to see a summary and preview of all the steps they needed to complete at this stage. This led to the idea of a ‘task list’ which outlines all the steps involved. Users felt that a drop down with relevant forms would be useful as not everyone in the organisation would know what a form was called.  
- Add a short answer question: there was some confusion as to what a ‘short’ and ‘long’ answer question was and this caused some hesitation - is a name a short question type or long?
- Add a number question: fairly easy to complete but some users wanted a numerical field rather than an open text field so they cold control the information they were receiving
- Previewing: some users were concerned that previewing a form would result them losing changes. This lea to the creation of the ‘save and preview’ button
- The preview pane: many users were either a) unsure of what the preview pane was and as a result ignored it or b) expected it to auto populate with questions. In both scenarios users missed out on the ability to preview the question.
- Adding a NI no: some users expected this to be formatted in two boxes to reflect how NI numbers appear
- Change question order: generally this feature works well but there was some confusion around the language used on the page and some users point out that this could be hard to use for very long forms. Users prior experience of Whitehall Publisher informs their expectations.
- Character limits in text boxes were seen as useful.
- Overall, many had a positive experience and completed tasks with relative ease. There were questions around whether a declaration was necessary in all scenario and how people could review the form. There was an expectation that there would be a 2i process and a preview version people could share. There was also the expectation that there would be a publish confirmation page before a form goes live.
