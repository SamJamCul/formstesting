## Usability Testing: Simple Routing

## Key Headlines 
- Most people looked for routing in the edit page of the question they wanted to skip. Most of them did not discover the ‘add question route’ button without prompting.
- When people were prompted to use the button, most successfully set up routes for forms with existing questions.
- Those users who understood routing largely understood error messages. It might be worth further testing on those involving question order changing.
- The more experienced user applied their mental model of ‘branching’ at times, and this led them to experience some friction with simple routing.
- Less digitally confident users found the tasks difficult. More confident people were able to complete them.
