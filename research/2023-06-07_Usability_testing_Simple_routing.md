## Usability testing: Simple Routing

## 2023-06-07 / Sprint 29-30

## Aims
- To test current design for simple routing with users
- To get feedback on how the language used to describe simple routing resonates with users and communicates the concepts
- To test error messages relating to simple routing with users

## Users
- Members of the public, one Civil Servant (who had immediate need for this feature)
- 7 users

## Methodology
- Usability Testing

## Key Headlines 
- Most people looked for routing in the ‘edit page’ of the question they wanted to skip. Most of them did not discover the ‘add question route’ button without prompting.
- When people were prompted to use the button, most successfully set up routes for forms with existing questions.
- Those users who understood routing largely understood error messages. It might be worth further testing on those involving question order changing.
- The more experienced user applied their mental model of ‘branching’ at times, and this led them to experience some friction with simple routing.
- Less digitally confident users found the tasks difficult. More confident people were able to complete them.
