# Testing form processing efficiency (GOV.UK Forms vs document-based)

## 2022-08-29 / Sprint 10

## Aims
- To capture estimated timings for current forms compared to GOV.UK Forms outputs
- To understand challenges and needs for processing the output of forms created with GOV.UK Forms

## Users
- Civil Servants
- 1

## Methodology
- Unmoderated interactive activity

## Key Headlines

The average times spent processing a form for each pot were:
- Existing forms: 3 minutes
- Existing forms with errors: 8 minutes 11 seconds
- GOV.UK Forms output: 2 minutes 58 seconds
- Getting missing information and checking if information is valid are the areas with the longest times recorded.

Qualitative feedback highlighted some common challenges and things that can slow the processing of forms down:
- Completers who donâ€™t put their LN claim number in the subject line of the email.
- It takes longer to find a CN case number than an LN claim number on the system
- Typos with claim or case numbers.
- Emails being sent from an email address that is not the same as the one on their claim.
