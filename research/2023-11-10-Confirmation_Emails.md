## Key Headlines 

- The current design for confirmation emails was welcomed by users. It might not fully meet all of their particular needs, but no issues were identified with implementing it.
- However, the current design left everyone we tested with unaware that the feature existed. When their attention was drawn to the content they clearly understood the feature. So the issue was awareness so they can write ‘what happens next’ content knowing it will be in this email.
- Being able to provide detailed information both in ‘what happens next’ and the emails was identified as a need. Currently users feel held back by not being able to add formatting or hyperlinks to their content.
- Including submitted answers in the confirmation emails was largely seen as a ‘nice to have’. We know this is essential for one service we are working with. We should do more work to understand how common this is.
- There were some related insights around agents submitting forms and other specific needs for confirmation emails.
