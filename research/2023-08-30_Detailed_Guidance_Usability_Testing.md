2023-08-30 / Sprint 35

## Aims
- To test the usability of the new iteration on the design for the ‘add a question’ journey.
- To test the usability of the ‘detailed guidance’ feature.
- To understand how well people are able to add markdown formatting to ‘detailed guidance’ using the ‘detailed guidance’ feature and the associated content

## Users
- Civil Servants
- 5 users

## Methodology
- Usability Testing

## Key Headlines 

- ‘Check your question’ was used well, and came across as a natural part of the process. Several users commented on how useful it was for them.
- ‘Detailed guidance’ was used with some trial and error. Participants mostly differentiated it from hints and used appropriately.
- Formatting using Markdown was very much trial and error. All participants completed some formatting and used the preview to verify this.
- There are a number of specific ways participants used the markdown input, preview and guidance that we should look at addressing. Some of these are related to content, some to design.
