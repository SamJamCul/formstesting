- Participants were clear about the journey from trial account to editors, and were keen to explore the tool for their uses.
- Some were less clear on whether they met the requirements, particularly around the type of organisation and whether that organisation is a partner.
- Each stage of the process was clear, but participants had a need to understand the whole process and how it would play out for them.
- We identified a number of specific and detailed issues to consider in the content of the journey.
