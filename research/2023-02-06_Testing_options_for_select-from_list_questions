# Usability testing: 'Select multiple items from a list' and interations on 'Autofill' features

## Key Headlines 

- General feedback was largely positive.There were some comments that there were too many steps to complete per question.
- Participants were successful with both options for the design and rated them as easy to use. But when asked to compare they preferred writing the question first, then the options.
- The autofill questions for 'name' and 'email' were used successfully. For a 'Name' question, several users read the option to ask for a title, said they didn’t think they needed it, and then selected it anyway.
- Success messages were noticed by most of the participants and this reassured them. Some did not notice them until prompted, but this didn’t appear to impede their progress.
- Setting the email was not clear to three participants. Two assumed the inbox would get a link to click on to confirm. This was due to not reading the content before moving to another task.
- Despite the original form having a use case for the ‘None of the above’ option, several participants chose not to use it. One participant expected that ‘None of the above’ would give the form completers the option to enter some text to explain further. Several commented that they would expect to be able to add an option for ‘Other’ that was followed by a text box to enter text.
- Some users commented that they would expect to be able to see what a question looked like as part of the process of creating it. This need to see what they are creating was also apparent when one user was selecting their question type. 
- One user commented that they did not expect the page to refresh and have to scroll back down each time. For longer forms this could require considerable scrolling.
