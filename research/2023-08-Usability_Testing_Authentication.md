# Usability Testing: Authentication and trial accounts

## Key Headlines 

- Using an email code rather than a password felt different to participants, but they were all relatively comfortable with it.
- Participants preferred the Auth0 journey due to the simple look and feel and the numeric codes.
- Most participants would have got started with the tool rather than reading the landing page thoroughly. But they said it was clear and useful when they read the content.
- The concept of a limited trial account was clearly understood. The main limitation was seen as not being able to share forms with the public. But participants werenâ€™t yet clear on how they would move beyond the trial.
