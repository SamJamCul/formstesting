## 2023-04-14 / Sprint 26

## Aims
To test the new designs for:
- creating a new draft of a live form
- preparing changes in a draft of a live form
- making your changes live

## Users
- Civil Servants
- 5 users

## Methodology
- Usability Testing

## Key Headlines 

- The concept of a live form you then make a draft of to edit was understood by users.
- Users noticed the ‘Live’ and ‘Draft labels and made use of them.
- All users managed to make the various changes to forms, with a few uncertain moments about general navigation.
- All users wanted to understand the form before editing, and used the question view and preview functions to successfully do this.
- Two users thought that the form would be put in a maintenance state and unavailable to completers while they were editing their draft.
- Two users did not make their form live, partly due to not noticing the link to do so.
