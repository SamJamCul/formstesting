# Usability Testing: Draft / Live feature 

## Key Headlines 

"- The concept of a live form you then make a draft of to edit was understood by users.
- Users noticed the ‘Live’ and ‘Draft labels and made use of them.
- All users managed to make the various changes to forms, with a few uncertain moments about general navigation.
- All users wanted to understand the form before editing, and used the question view and preview functions to successfully do this.
- Two users thought that the form would be put in a maintenance state and unavailable to completers while they were editing their draft.
- Two users did not make their form live, partly due to not noticing the link to do so."
