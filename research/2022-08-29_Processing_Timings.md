# Processing Timings

## Key Headlines

- The average times spent processing forms were:
-- Existing forms: 3 minutes
-- Existing forms with errors: 8 minutes 11 seconds
-- GOV.UK Forms output: 2 minutes 58 seconds
- Getting missing information and checking if information is valid are the areas with the longest times recorded.
- There was also some qualitative feedback included on common challenges and things that can slow the processing down:
-- Completers who donâ€™t put their reference number in the subject line of the email.
-- Typos with claim or case numbers.
-- Emails being sent from an email address that is not the same as the one on their claim.
