# Usability Testing: Form Completers

## 2023-08-01 / Sprint 31-32

## Aims
- Test usability of forms created using GOV.UK Forms, including all current answer types.
- Compare usability and time taken for these with document based forms

## Users
- Members of the public
- 6 users

## Methodology
- Usability Testing

## Key Headlines 

- GOV.UK Forms were preferred to document based forms.
- There was lots of positive feedback about features that make GOV.UK Forms easy and clear to complete.
- We observed people complete forms more fully and accurately when they were in GOV.UK Forms format.
- When looking for help, several people said they would prefer information to help them to solve the problem. Contacting a civil servant for help was not what they were looking for.
- Several situations showed that giving form completers enough context is very important. There may be some opportunities to further support form builders to do this.
