## Key Headlines 

- The data is being used at two different levels  
  - First a very general check, which our planned MVP would support  
  - Second as a guide to problems with specific questions, which it would not.
- None of the participants were manipulating the data and few were using it to report to others.
- Generally people were happy with the format of the data as a spreadsheet attached to an email. One person suggested the spreadsheet could contain data from multiple forms for comparison.
- It seems most people using this data do not see themselves as particularly capable with using data. There is a need to make the data clear and help them confidently understand what implications to draw from it.
