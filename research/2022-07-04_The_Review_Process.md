# Understanding the review process

## Key Headlines

- The need to change a form comes from one of three teams: the policy team, the customer service team, or the processing team.
- All teams have to request a change via the Content Change Request form as a first step. This is sent to the Content Team who review it, estimate the amount of work needed and triage it to the appropriate team.
- A small change may be a content tweak based on customer feedback and this is dealt with quickly and informally. A large change, such as a format change, may take much longer and a full multidisciplinary project team may be assembled
- For form creators, it can be difficult to make MS Word documents look correct as often adding multiple comments causes formatting issues.
- Sometimes it can be difficult to review a document when there are too many changes making it ‘difficult to look at’ and hard to see where relevant changes are.
- Form creators want control over the review process similar to a fact check, where policy people or legal can only comment on specific sections of the form.
- The sign off process can be a long process as different changes are circulated through different teams. Version control becomes an issue.
- Final sign off for RPS is done by the Service Manager but before that he will give an initial sign off where it will go through the Policy team, CST, business areas and then back to the manager to confirm.
- The amend my personal details form is a basic form and it hasn’t needed many iterations to develop. When it comes to reviewing and changing it, it is updated quickly and informally.
- Other form creators we’ve spoken to tell us that the track changes feature is important in order to collect feedback from relevant people. Some users like to create the form in MS Word first so it can be reviewed and then copied as a final version into a form builder e.g. Survey Monkey.
