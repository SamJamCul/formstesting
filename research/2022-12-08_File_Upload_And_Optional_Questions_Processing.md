# File upload and optional questions processing

## Key Headlines

- Form processors preferred documents sent to them as attachments, not as individual links. This is largely because of the convenience of having files to preview in an inbox, and the time it takes to follow and download links.
- Many form processors who receive documents require multiple documents. 80% need more than one document.
- The majority of people receiving documents receive scans or photos, so capacity is needed for larger file sizes.
- Most people keep documents in their own file systems or case management system.
- Most people seem to prefer showing optional questions in the forms output, even if those questions have not been completed.
