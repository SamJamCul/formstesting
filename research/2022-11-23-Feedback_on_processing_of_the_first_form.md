# Feedback on processing of the first form

## Key Headlines

- The form processors reported a positive overall  experience, although there have been some teething issues along the way
- Including a question with ‘LN numbers or case reference numbers’ led to an increase in processing time.
- The processors reported an issue with receiving information that required a decimal point e.g. number of days taken. This has been resolved.
- An inconsistent experience for claimants where some similar forms can be completed via a webform, and other forms need to be completed with document-based submissions.
- Processors reported an improvement in processing time of between 1.5 – 2.5 minutes per form. Much of this was attributed to receiving information in more organised, well laid out fashion making it easier find and transpose into the CMS
