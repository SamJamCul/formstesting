# Feedback on processing of the first form

2022-11-23 / Sprint 16

## Aims
- Collect feedback from their processing team on what the experience with GOV.UK Forms has been like generally 
- Understand what has worked well and not so well
- Identify ways we can improve going forward

## Users
- Civil Servants

## Methodology
- Focus Group / Interview

## Key Headlines

- The form processors reported a positive overall experience, although there have been some teething issues along the way
- Including a question with ‘LN numbers or case reference numbers’ led to an increase in processing time.
- The processors reported an issue with receiving information that required a decimal point e.g. number of days taken. This has been resolved.
- An inconsistent experience for claimants where some similar forms can be completed via a webform, and other forms need to be completed with document-based submissions.
- Processors reported an improvement in processing time of between 1.5 – 2.5 minutes per form. Much of this was attributed to receiving information in more organised, well laid out fashion making it easier to find and transpose into the CMS
