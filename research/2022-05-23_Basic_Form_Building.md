# Usability testing: Basic Form Building

2022-05-23 / Sprint 3

## Aims
To test basic form builder journeys, including:
- Adding a short answer question (iterated user story)
- Adding a date question (iterated user story)
- Previewing a question (iterated user story)
- Change the name of a form (new)
- Change / edit the content of questions (new)
- Change preview formatting (new)
- Delete a question (new) 
- Test a form (new)

## Key Headlines

- Name your form page: This page works well for users and it received positive feedback. The use of additional hint text made it clearer what users were being asked for and it overcomes problems with uncertainty of what the form should be named
- Form overview page: users understand what this page is for and have clear expectations of what would happen to this page as they continue through their journey. However, users wanted an explicit option to change/ edit the name of a form rather than use the ‘back button’
- Edit question page: overall this page works well and several improvements were noted around hint text helping users understand what is being asked of them, use of question numbers which help users understand where they are in the process and improvements in how long version vs short version is displayed. However, there is still some confusion over what value a short name provides and reference to a ‘list’ wasn’t clear (it’s a summary or overview). As in the previous research, there was uncertainty around saving/ how to save the form.
- Preview pane: Preview pane is confusing initially and users don't know what's its for. However, it becomes much more useful when editing/ or going back to a question
- Preview in a new tab: often users did not see the link and therefore missed the opportunity to use it. Some felt this would be more useful at the end of the process after questions have been created and the form creator is reviewing all the questions in one go.   
- Form overview page: this page is clear and gives users confidence questions are being saved as they go along providing a useful reference point. Some believe it would be beneficial to add numbers on question to make it easier to navigate. The ‘publish’ button can cause confusion/ hesitation as users expect to have to configure the form before publishing or go through some kind of verification.
- Returning to a form to make a change: generally users found it easy to return to a form and make changes. The preview pane was seen more easily when returning to the form and where the pane auto populates with the question format.
- Deleting a question: this was completed easily for users
- Users surfaced some general concerns about who would have access to the forms before it goes live and the potential proliferation of ‘spurious, unnecessary’ forms. "
