# Support Model User Research

## 2024-12-23 / Sprint 43

## Aims
- Understand needs for support of existing and potential future forms
- Understand user expectations in terms of service level and support
- Identify any areas where service level or support may present barriers to adoption

## Users
- Civil Servants
- 4 users

## Methodology
- Interviews / Review of support tickets

## Key Headlines 

- Only 4% of support tickets were related to user issues. 
- Interviews confirm that people see Forms as reliable and low risk.
- 25% of tickets were requests for information on the product, often information that is already available somewhere.
- Users have expectations of support related to their experience of other GDS products and GOV.UK. They expect quick initial responses, but understand fixes to issues may take several days.
- They want clear information so they can take action their side, such as updating landing pages or putting in place mitigations.
- Directing form completers to the appropriate action or alternative contacts is the action participants saw as most pressing. We could consider how we make sure contact details are available in case of any downtime or errors.
- Issues with the runner are likely higher priority than the admin, but there are some situations where urgent admin access would be needed to correct errors or launch new time sensitive forms.
