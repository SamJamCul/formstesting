# Accessibility testing: Form building

## 2022-07-20 / Sprint 5

## Aims
To test accessibility of basic form builder journeys, including:
- Basic building a form journeys

- Add a long answer question and a date question (combination task)
- Add a short answer question 
- Add a National Insurance number 
- Add a phone number
- Preview a question 

Return to a form journeys:
- Change the name of a form 
- Change/ edit the content of questions 
- Change preview formatting
- Delete a question 
- Test a form 
- Reorder questions

## Users
- Members of the public
- People with accessibility needs
- 6 users

## Methodology
- Usability Testing (Accessibility)

## Key Headlines

- All users successfully created a form, including participant using a screen reader.
- The product was compared favourably to inaccessible forms by several users. It was also compared favourably to other form building tools.
- Users appreciated simple, clear design and language, and one question per page design.
- Users appreciated familiar visual presentation from GOV.UK.
- The product worked well with colour screen overlays.
- Users who use screen readers to support reading rather than for full navigation did not feel it necessary to use the reader for the tasks undertaken.
- There were some issues experienced by the user using a screen reader to navigate the site
-- Radio buttons in the question type selection did not seem to be immediately discoverable
-- Edit links on the form overview page were not clear. The user did not have the contextual information to clearly navigate these or understand their purpose.
-- User was unsure whether the save button would move them to another page. They were hesitant to use it as when using a screen reader moving to another page requires users to undertake the effort to re-orient themselves to the new page.
-- Preview in a new tab caused a navigation challenge with getting out of the preview and back to form editing.
- We saw some similar challenges to other usability testing:
-- Some challenges being clear when user was taking the role of 'form creator' and when they were previewing as 'form completer'.
-- Re-ordering questions was not clear to all users.
-- Some uncertainty around whether work had been saved when creating a question.
-- Some uncertainty as to what the preview pane did, particularly before users had saved a question and it had populated with their content.
-- Users often needed to consider answer type before they were able to write useful hint text, but the current interface asks for hint text first. They are also not shown how the answer type will display in the preview pane until they have saved a question. Some users re wrote their hint text after saving and previewing.
