# DR000: Recording our project decisions on GitHub using the ADR Process

Date: 2022-02-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Various decision have been made during the Discovery and Alpha phases by the GOV.UK Forms team, but until now they have not been recorded consistently or centrally. 

## Decision

Use the Architecture Decision Records approach to record all significant decisions that are made, using GitHub files on the public repository, with a decision record template.

## Consequences

Everyone on the team needs to have access to and be familiar with using GitHub Files so that they can record decisions. 
Consistent and accurate records of decisions will ensure that the team members and others interested in our work have a clear grasp of core decisions and aims of the GOV.UK Forms project.
