# DR003: We have identified enough common features to tackle at least 965 (25%) forms as our minimum target range.

Date: 2021-10-15

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We needed to know whether there is enough value in building a common platform according to: 
- Epic 2: are there enough common form features to build a common platform?
- And the 11th & 15th riskiest assumptions:
     - 11th - ID44:That the forms in the long tail can/should be turned into digital services)
     - 15th - ID13: We can build a product that provides enough patterns and components to cover a sufficient number of government forms / transactions (bearing in mind that many online forms have some fairly technical features like branching, address pickers, autocompletes, document uploads etc.

We audited a sample of forms on GOV.UK to learn which features are most commonly required.

## Decision
We will provide features needed to theoretically tackle at least 6 forms in private beta. 

We are assured that by having the listed form features we will be able to tackle 26 forms at the start of private beta and later 189 forms. This will enable us to assess the demand for the gov.uk forms platform by working with 5% of our target group. 

These features also give us some flexibility to partner with teams creating forms for 3 brand new lower volume services.

## Consequences

1. With the confidence of common form features we have put in a plan to reach out to teams to partner for our private beta with our goal to get 10 partnerships from the top 20 organisations.

2. Any technical/architectural considerations, now that we know what to build for private beta.
