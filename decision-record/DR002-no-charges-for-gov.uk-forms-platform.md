## Status

Accepted

## Context

Related to [Epic 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y5iSEumAuLBaKtgvyhNaGagboN7XziAnQMfuwdVpiZM/edit#) and our [second and fifth riskiest assumptions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gUZeEXSU8uhPcNJxQWGZ4oxOzANx0-EolDnVqZ0qsMg/edit?pli=1#gid=0) (ID16, ID30), we wanted to know if we can make adoption of forms cost-effective during private beta and beyond. 
We tested different price points with decision-makers and different business models with our sponsors during spending review.

## Decision

We will not charge users for using our platform. 

## Consequences

Positive - our users will be able to use the GOV.UK Form building platform at no cost.
