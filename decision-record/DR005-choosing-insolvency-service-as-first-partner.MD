# DR005: Choosing The Insolvency Service as our first private beta partner

Date: 2022-03-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We are fortunate to have lots of organisations that have said they’d like to partner with us for our private beta. We were considering which comparatively simple forms we could start with so we can start testing the GOV.UK Forms platform as soon as possible. The Insolvency Service were keen to improve their ["Amend my redundancy payment claim"](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/amend-your-redundancy-claim) set of forms, some of which were quite simple.

## Decision

We chose The Insolvency Service as our first private beta partner, and think specifically that the "Amend my personal details on my redundancy claim" form would be the simplest form for them to tackle first.

## Consequences

We prioritised starting our private beta phase by designing, building and testing user stories with The Insolvency Service that should allow them to tackle the “Amend my personal details on my redundancy claim” form. We’re telling other organisations that we’ll be in touch soon to kick off subsequent partnerships.
